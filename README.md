# <Yes-We-Kanban>

## Description
Time managment is one of the most critical skills in any profession and in our daily lives. 
This simple Kanban board sets out to aid the user in tracking and prioritizing tasks 
I was motivated to build this project to help myself keep track of upcoming tasks related to school, work, and my personal life.
i does this by ustilizing Jquery's draggable and droppable features as well as its datepicker features and the native dayjs() functionalities.

## Usage

Simply press the green add task button and fill out tthe information. Drag and drop the generated card as you work your way through your tasks. 


## Credits

Jquery


## Features

Addition and deletion of tasks.

Color codes tasks by due date to visualy aid the user. 

## How to Contribute

Moving forward I would like to explore Jqueries draggable and droppable features so that the task cards snap to the box and each other for a more uniform look.
